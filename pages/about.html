    <center> <h1>About Me</h1> </center>

    <p>I grew up in Michigan. I did my undergrad at Michigan State University (MSU). I spent several years working with the IceCube Collaboration, including neural networks for event reconstruction and a statistical search for neutrinos from dark matter (DM) annihilation in dwarf galaxies.</p>
    <p>I'm now a second-year graduate student at Georgia Institute of Techonology (Georgia Tech / GT). I do research with Dr. John Wise on the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBH) in the early universe.</p>
