        <p>At MSU, I was an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for three semesters. I was a ULA in two of the introductory astronomy courses for astrophysics majors, the first of which was also open to non-majors as an elective. The first course covered the conceptual principles of astronomy. The second course covered the mathematics behind telescopes and exoplanets, and including a laboratory portion where students working with real astronomical data in Jupyter notebooks.</p>
        <p>At Georgia Tech, I was a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for five semesters. I was a GTA teaching algebra-based mechanics to non-majors. For three of these semesters, I was the Head TA, responsible for managing the other GTAs and UTAs and the course's online discussion forum. I was a Head TA for over 2,500 students, and I was recognized as one of two Online Head TAs of the Year during Georgia Tech's 2023-2024 academic year.</p>
