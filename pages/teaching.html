        <p>At MSU, I was an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for three semesters. I was a ULA in two of the introductory astronomy courses for astrophysics majors, the first of which was also open to non-majors as an elective. The first course covered the conceptual principles of astronomy. The second course covered the mathematics behind telescopes and exoplanets, and included a laboratory portion where students worked with real astronomical data in Jupyter notebooks.</p>
        <p> <img src="/assets/img/online_head_TA_award.jpg" alt="Online Head TA of the Year" style="width:375px;height:500px;float:left;margin-right:10px;"> At Georgia Tech, I've been a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for six semesters. For five semesters, I was a GTA teaching algebra-based mechanics to non-majors. For three of those semesters, I was the Head TA, responsible for managing the other GTAs and UTAs and the course's online discussion forum. I was a Head TA for over 2,500 students, and I was recognized as one of two Online Head TAs of the Year during Georgia Tech's 2023-2024 academic year. During the sixth semester, I'm currently a GTA for an introductory astronomy course covering the solar system.</p>
        <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Tech to Teaching program, a certification program aimed at perparing graduate students for future instructional roles in higher education. This program includes coursework on a variety of topics such as learning theory, student motivation and engagement, learner-centered teaching, active learning, course design, and universal design for learning (UDL). The Tech to Teaching program culminates in a teaching capstone where participants serve as a co-instructor or instructor of record for a course and are responsible for teaching at least two lectures. I am completing the Tech to Teaching capstone this semester with the introductory astronomy course.</p>
